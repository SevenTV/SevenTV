	<h2>DMCA policy</h2>
	<p>
		This Digital Millennium Copyright Act policy ("Policy") applies to the 7tv.app website
		("Website" or "Service") and any of its related products and services (collectively, "Services")
		and outlines how SEVENTV SARL addresses copyright infringement notifications and how you ("you"
		or "your") may submit a copyright infringement complaint.
	</p>
	<p>
		Protection of intellectual property is of utmost importance to us and we ask our users and their
		authorised agents to do the same. It is our policy to expeditiously respond to clear
		notifications of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the United States Digital
		Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") of 1998, the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright
		Office website.
	</p>
	<h2>What to consider before submitting a copyright complaint</h2>
	<p>
		Before submitting a copyright complaint to us, consider whether the use could be considered fair
		use. Fair use states that brief excerpts of copyrighted material may, under certain
		circumstances, be quoted verbatim for purposes such as criticism, news reporting, teaching, and
		research, without the need for permission from or payment to the copyright holder. If you have
		considered fair use, and you still wish to continue with a copyright complaint, you may want to
		first reach out to the user in question to see if you can resolve the matter directly with the
		user.
	</p>
	<p>
		Please note that under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), you may be liable for any damages, including costs
		and attorneys’ fees incurred by us or our users, if you knowingly misrepresent that the material
		or activity is infringing. If you are unsure whether the material you are reporting is in fact
		infringing, you may wish to contact an attorney before filing a notification with us.
	</p>
	<p>
		We may, at our discretion or as required by law, share a copy of your notification or
		counter-notification with the account holder engaged in the allegedly infringing activity or for
		publication. If you are concerned about your information being forwarded, you may wish to use an
		agent to report infringing material for you.
	</p>
	<h2>Notifications of infringement</h2>
	<p>
		If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof, and you believe that any material available on
		our Services infringes your copyrights, then you may submit a written copyright infringement
		notification ("Notification") using the contact details below pursuant to the DMCA by providing
		us with the following information:
	</p>
	<p>
		Identification of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed, or, if multiple
		copyrighted works are covered by this Notification, you may provide a representative list of the
		copyrighted works that you claim have been infringed.
	</p>
	<p>
		Identification of the infringing material and information you claim is infringing (or the
		subject of infringing activity), including at a minimum, if applicable, the URL or URLs of the
		web pages where the allegedly infringing material may be found.
	</p>
	<p>
		Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as an address, telephone
		number, and, if available, an e-mail address.
	</p>
	<p>
		A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained
		of is not authorised by the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or the law.
	</p>
	<p>
		A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury
		that you are authorised to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly
		infringed.
	</p>
	<p>
		A physical or electronic signature (typing your full name will suffice) of the copyright owner
		or a person authorised to act on their behalf.
	</p>
	<p>
		All such Notifications must comply with the DMCA requirements. You may refer to a DMCA takedown
		notice generator or other similar services to avoid making mistakes and ensure compliance of
		your Notification.
	</p>
	<p>
		Filing a DMCA complaint is the start of a pre-defined legal process. Your complaint will be
		reviewed for accuracy, validity, and completeness. If your complaint has satisfied these
		requirements, our response may include the removal or restriction of access to allegedly
		infringing material as well as a permanent termination of repeat infringers’ accounts. A backup
		of the terminated account’s data may be requested, however it may be subject to certain penalty
		fees imposed. The final penalty fee will be determined by the severity and frequency of the
		violations.
	</p>
	<p>
		If we remove or restrict access to materials or terminate an account in response to a
		Notification of alleged infringement, we will make a good faith effort to contact the affected
		user with information concerning the removal or restriction of access, which may include a full
		copy of your Notification (including your name, address, phone, and email address), along with
		instructions for filing a counter-notification.
	</p>
	<p>
		Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any portion of this Policy, SEVENTV SARL
		reserves the right to take no action upon receipt of a DMCA copyright infringement notification
		if it fails to comply with all the requirements of the DMCA for such notifications.
	</p>
	<h2>Counter-notifications</h2>
	<p>
		A user who receives a copyright infringement Notification may make a counter-Notification
		pursuant to sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the US Copyright Act. If you receive a copyright
		infringement Notification, it means that the material described in the Notification has been
		removed from our Services or access to the material has been restricted. Please take the time to
		read through the Notification, which includes information on the Notification we received as
		well as instructions on how to file a counter-notifications.
	</p>
	<p>
		To file a counter-notification with us, you must provide a written communication that sets out
		the information specified in the list below:
	</p>

		Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been restricted and
		the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was
		restricted.
	</p>
	<p>
		Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as an address, telephone
		number, and, if available, an e-mail address.
	</p>
	<p>
		A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was
		removed or restricted as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed
		or restricted.
	</p>
	<p>
		A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal district court for the judicial
		district in which the address is located (or if you are outside of the United States, that you
		consent to the jurisdiction of any judicial district in which the service provider may be
		found), and that you will accept service of process from the person or company who provided the
		original infringement notification.
	</p>
	<p>
		A physical or electronic signature (typing your full name will suffice) of the copyright owner
		or a person authorised to act on their behalf.
	</p>
	<p>
		Please note that you may be liable for, including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred by us or
		our users, if you knowingly misrepresent that the material or activity is not infringing the
		copyrights of others or that the material or activity was removed or restricted by mistake or
		misidentification. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether certain material infringes the
		copyrights of others or that the material or activity was removed or restricted by mistake or
		misidentification, you may wish to contact an attorney before filing a counter-notification.
	</p>
	<p>
		Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any portion of this Policy, SEVENTV SARL
		reserves the right to take no action upon receipt of a counter-notification. If we receive a
		counter-notification that complies with the terms of 17 U.S.C. § 512(g), we may forward it to
		the person who filed the original Notification.
	</p>
	<p>
		The process described in this Policy does not limit our ability to pursue any other remedies we
		may have to address suspected infringement.
