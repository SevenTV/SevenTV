			Celebrate the season with 7TV's Minecraft Hunger Games Tournament and special sub-gifting
			event! Compete, gift, and enjoy exclusive rewards while engaging with your favorite streamers
			and their communities!
		</p>

		<hr />

		<h2>Minecraft Hunger Games</h2>

		<p>
			Survive and eliminate other players while staying within the shrinking playable area. Last
			team standing will be crowned as the event winner. On December 14th or 21st, the tournament
			will be streamed on the 7TV Twitch channel: <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/7tvapp"
				>twitch.tv/7tvapp</a
			>
		</p>

		<h2>Tournament structure</h2>

		<h3>Community stage</h3>

		<p>
			A game of hunger games will be played between members of a streamer's community alongside the
			streamer. The winner of each game will team up with their streamer for the final stage.
		</p>

		<h3>Finals</h3>

		<p>
			Unlike the community stage, the game will be played in teams of two - the streamer and the
			winner of the community stage. Those teams will compete against other winner/streamer duos.
			The last team standing will be declared the winner.
		</p>

		<h3>Rewards</h3>

			Winners and participating content creators participating, and those who restream the event on
			their channels will receive free 7TV subscriptions and a unique animated Winter paint!

				community help with the design! Not great at arts? Don't worry, we can help you create one

		</ul>

		<h4>For Restreamers</h4>
